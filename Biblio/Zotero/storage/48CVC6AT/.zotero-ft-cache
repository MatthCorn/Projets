GLOSSARY
Virtual Environment
A virtual environment is a digital space that simulates the physical world or a completely new and unique environment.

It is created using computer technology and can be accessed through various devices such as computers, smartphones, and virtual reality headsets.

In a virtual environment, users can interact with objects, people, and surroundings in a way that feels immersive and realistic.

This technology has a wide range of applications, from entertainment and gaming to education, training, and simulation. Virtual environments are often used for training purposes, allowing users to practice skills and scenarios in a safe and controlled setting.

For example, medical students can perform virtual surgeries, pilots can practice flying planes, and soldiers can simulate combat situations. In addition to training, virtual environments are also used for collaborative work and communication.

Teams can meet in a virtual space to brainstorm ideas, work on projects, and hold meetings, even if they are located in different parts of the world. Overall, virtual environments offer a unique and innovative way to experience and interact with the world around us.

As technology continues to advance, the possibilities for virtual environments are endless, and they are sure to play an increasingly important role in our lives.
