ABSTRACT
The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers’ equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.
1 INTRODUCTION
Many problems in science and engineering involve solving complex partial differential equation (PDE) systems repeatedly for different values of some parameters. Examples arise in molecular dynamics, micro-mechanics, and turbulent flows. Often such systems require fine discretization in order to capture the phenomenon being modeled. As a consequence, traditional numerical solvers are slow and sometimes inefficient. For example, when designing materials such as airfoils, one needs to solve the associated inverse problem where thousands of evaluations of the forward model are needed. A fast method can make such problems feasible.
Conventional solvers vs. Data-driven methods. Traditional solvers such as finite element methods (FEM) and finite difference methods (FDM) solve the equation by discretizing the space. Therefore, they impose a trade-off on the resolution: coarse grids are fast but less accurate; fine grids are accurate but slow. Complex PDE systems, as described above, usually require a very fine discretization, and therefore very challenging and time-consuming for traditional solvers. On the other hand, data-driven methods can directly learn the trajectory of the family of equations from the data. As a result, the learning-based method can be orders of magnitude faster than the conventional solvers.
Machine learning methods may hold the key to revolutionizing scientific disciplines by providing fast solvers that approximate or enhance traditional ones (Raissi et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020; Greenfeld et al., 2019; Kochkov et al., 2021). However, classical neural networks map between finite-dimensional spaces and can therefore only learn solutions tied to a specific discretization. This is often a limitation for practical applications and therefore the development of mesh-invariant neural networks is required. We first outline two mainstream neural network-based approaches for PDEs – the finite-dimensional operators and Neural-FEM.
Finite-dimensional operators. These approaches parameterize the solution operator as a deep convolutional neural network between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces Guo et al. (2016); Zhu

& Zabaras (2018); Adler & Oktem (2017); Bhatnagar et al. (2019); Khoo et al. (2017). Such approaches are, by definition, mesh-dependent and will need modifications and tuning for different resolutions and discretizations in order to achieve consistent error (if at all possible). Furthermore, these approaches are limited to the discretization size and geometry of the training data and hence, it is not possible to query solutions at new points in the domain. In contrast, we show, for our method, both invariance of the error to grid resolution, and the ability to transfer the solution between meshes.
Neural-FEM. The second approach directly parameterizes the solution function as a neural network (E & Yu, 2018; Raissi et al., 2019; Bar & Sochen, 2019; Smith et al., 2020; Pan & Duraisamy, 2020). This approach is designed to model one specific instance of the PDE, not the solution operator. It is mesh-independent and accurate, but for any given new instance of the functional parameter/coefficient, it requires training a new neural network. The approach closely resembles classical methods such as finite elements, replacing the linear span of a finite set of local basis functions with the space of neural networks. The Neural-FEM approach suffers from the same computational issue as classical methods: the optimization problem needs to be solved for every new instance. Furthermore, the approach is limited to a setting in which the underlying PDE is known.
Neural Operators. Recently, a new line of work proposed learning mesh-free, infinitedimensional operators with neural networks (Lu et al., 2019; Bhattacharya et al., 2020; Nelsen & Stuart, 2020; Li et al., 2020b;a; Patel et al., 2021). The neural operator remedies the mesh-dependent nature of the finite-dimensional operator methods discussed above by producing a single set of network parameters that may be used with different discretizations. It has the ability to transfer solutions between meshes. Furthermore, the neural operator needs to be trained only once. Obtaining a solution for a new instance of the parameter requires only a forward pass of the network, alleviating the major computational issues incurred in Neural-FEM methods. Lastly, the neural operator requires no knowledge of the underlying PDE, only data. Thus far, neural operators have not yielded efficient numerical algorithms that can parallel the success of convolutional or recurrent neural networks in the finite-dimensional setting due to the cost of evaluating integral operators. Through the fast Fourier transform, our work alleviates this issue.
Fourier Transform. The Fourier transform is frequently used in spectral methods for solving differential equations, since differentiation is equivalent to multiplication in the Fourier domain. Fourier transforms have also played an important role in the development of deep learning. In theory, they appear in the proof of the universal approximation theorem (Hornik et al., 1989) and, empirically, they have been used to speed up convolutional neural networks (Mathieu et al., 2013). Neural network architectures involving the Fourier transform or the use of sinusoidal activation functions have also been proposed and studied (Bengio et al., 2007; Mingo et al., 2004; Sitzmann et al., 2020). Recently, some spectral methods for PDEs have been extended to neural networks (Fan et al., 2019a;b; Kashinath et al., 2020). We build on these works by proposing a neural operator architecture defined directly in Fourier space with quasi-linear time complexity and state-of-the-art approximation capabilities.

Our Contributions. We introduce the Fourier neural operator, a novel deep learning architecture able to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces of functions; the integral operator is restricted to a convolution, and instantiated through a linear transformation in the Fourier domain.
• The Fourier neural operator is the first work that learns the resolution-invariant solution operator for the family of Navier-Stokes equation in the turbulent regime, where previous graph-based neural operators do not converge.
• By construction, the method shares the same learned network parameters irrespective of the discretization used on the input and output spaces. It can do zero-shot super-resolution: trained on a lower resolution directly evaluated on a higher resolution, as shown in Figure 1.
• The proposed method consistently outperforms all existing deep learning methods even when fixing the resolution to be 64×64. It achieves error rates that are 30% lower on Burgers’ Equation, 60% lower on Darcy Flow, and 30% lower on Navier Stokes (turbulent regime with viscosity ν = 1e−4). When learning the mapping for the entire time series, the method achieves < 1% error with viscosity ν = 1e−3 and 8% error with viscosity ν = 1e−4.
• On a 256 × 256 grid, the Fourier neural operator has an inference time of only 0.005s compared to the 2.2s of the pseudo-spectral method used to solve Navier-Stokes. Despite its tremendous speed advantage, the method does not suffer from accuracy degradation when used in downstream applications such as solving the Bayesian inverse problem, as shown in Figure 6.
We observed that the proposed framework can approximate complex operators raising in PDEs that are highly non-linear, with high frequency modes and slow energy decay. The power of neural operators comes from combining linear, global integral operators (via the Fourier transform) and nonlinear, local activation functions. Similar to the way standard neural networks approximate highly non-linear functions by combining linear multiplications with non-linear activations, the proposed neural operators can approximate highly non-linear operators.
2 LEARNING OPERATORS
Our methodology learns a mapping between two infinite dimensional spaces from a finite collection of observed input-output pairs. Let D ⊂ Rd be a bounded, open set and A = A(D; Rda ) and U = U (D; Rdu ) be separable Banach spaces of function taking values in Rda and Rdu respectively. Furthermore let G† : A → U be a (typically) non-linear map. We study maps G† which arise as the solution operators of parametric PDEs – see Section 5 for examples. Suppose we have observations {aj , uj }N
j=1 where aj ∼ μ is an i.i.d. sequence from the probability measure μ supported on A
and uj = G†(aj) is possibly corrupted with noise. We aim to build an approximation of G† by constructing a parametric map
G : A × Θ → U or equivalently, Gθ : A → U , θ ∈ Θ (1)
for some finite-dimensional parameter space Θ by choosing θ† ∈ Θ so that G(·, θ†) = Gθ† ≈ G†. This is a natural framework for learning in infinite-dimensions as one could define a cost functional C : U × U → R and seek a minimizer of the problem
min
θ∈Θ Ea∼μ[C(G(a, θ), G†(a))]
which directly parallels the classical finite-dimensional setting (Vapnik, 1998). Showing the existence of minimizers, in the infinite-dimensional setting, remains a challenging open problem. We will approach this problem in the test-train setting by using a data-driven empirical approximation to the cost used to determine θ and to test the accuracy of the approximation. Because we conceptualize our methodology in the infinite-dimensional setting, all finite-dimensional approximations share a common set of parameters which are consistent in infinite dimensions. A table of notation is shown in Appendix 3.
Learning the Operator. Approximating the operator G† is a different and typically much more challenging task than finding the solution u ∈ U of a PDE for a single instance of the parameter a ∈ A. Most existing methods, ranging from classical finite elements, finite differences, and finite volumes to modern machine learning approaches such as physics-informed neural networks

(PINNs) (Raissi et al., 2019) aim at the latter and can therefore be computationally expensive. This makes them impractical for applications where a solution to the PDE is required for many different instances of the parameter. On the other hand, our approach directly approximates the operator and is therefore much cheaper and faster, offering tremendous computational savings when compared to traditional solvers. For an example application to Bayesian inverse problems, see Section 5.5.
Discretization. Since our data aj and uj are, in general, functions, to work with them numerically, we assume access only to point-wise evaluations. Let Dj = {x1, . . . , xn} ⊂ D be a n-point discretization of the domain D and assume we have observations aj|Dj ∈ Rn×da , uj|Dj ∈ Rn×dv , for a finite collection of input-output pairs indexed by j. To be discretization-invariant, the neural operator can produce an answer u(x) for any x ∈ D, potentially x ∈/ Dj. Such a property is highly desirable as it allows a transfer of solutions between different grid geometries and discretizations.
3 NEURAL OPERATOR
The neural operator, proposed in (Li et al., 2020b), is formulated as an iterative architecture v0 7→ v1 7→ . . . 7→ vT where vj for j = 0, 1, . . . , T − 1 is a sequence of functions each taking values in Rdv . As shown in Figure 2 (a), the input a ∈ A is first lifted to a higher dimensional representation v0(x) = P (a(x)) by the local transformation P which is usually parameterized by a shallow fullyconnected neural network. Then we apply several iterations of updates vt 7→ vt+1 (defined below).
The output u(x) = Q(vT (x)) is the projection of vT by the local transformation Q : Rdv → Rdu . In each iteration, the update vt 7→ vt+1 is defined as the composition of a non-local integral operator K and a local, nonlinear activation function σ.
Definition 1 (Iterative updates) Define the update to the representation vt 7→ vt+1 by
vt+1(x) := σ

, ∀x ∈ D (2)
where K : A × ΘK → L(U (D; Rdv ), U (D; Rdv )) maps to bounded linear operators on U (D; Rdv )
and is parameterized by φ ∈ ΘK, W : Rdv → Rdv is a linear transformation, and σ : R → R is a non-linear activation function whose action is defined component-wise.
We choose K(a; φ) to be a kernel integral transformation parameterized by a neural network.

where κφ : R2(d+da) → Rdv×dv is a neural network parameterized by φ ∈ ΘK.
Here κφ plays the role of a kernel function which we learn from data. Together definitions 1 and 2 constitute a generalization of neural networks to infinite-dimensional spaces as first proposed in Li et al. (2020b). Notice even the integral operator is linear, the neural operator can learn highly non-linear operators by composing linear integral operators with non-linear activation functions, analogous to standard neural networks.
If we remove the dependence on the function a and impose κφ(x, y) = κφ(x − y), we obtain that (3) is a convolution operator, which is a natural choice from the perspective of fundamental solutions. We exploit this fact in the following section by parameterizing κφ directly in Fourier space and using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to efficiently compute (3). This leads to a fast architecture that obtains state-of-the-art results for PDE problems.
4 FOURIER NEURAL OPERATOR
We propose replacing the kernel integral operator in (3), by a convolution operator defined in Fourier space. Let F denote the Fourier transform of a function f : D → Rdv and F −1 its inverse then
(F f )j(k) =
∫
D
fj (x)e−2iπ〈x,k〉dx, (F −1f )j (x) =
∫
D
fj (k)e2iπ〈x,k〉dk
for j = 1, . . . , dv where i = √−1 is the imaginary unit. By letting κφ(x, y, a(x), a(y)) = κφ(x−y) in (3) and applying the convolution theorem, we find that (K(a; φ)vt
)(x) = F −1(F (κφ) · F (vt))(x), ∀x ∈ D.
We, therefore, propose to directly parameterize κφ in Fourier space.
Definition 3 (Fourier integral operator K) Define the Fourier integral operator
(K(φ)vt
)(x) = F −1(
Rφ · (F vt)
)
(x) ∀x ∈ D (4)
where Rφ is the Fourier transform of a periodic function κ : D ̄ → Rdv×dv parameterized by φ ∈ ΘK. An illustration is given in Figure 2 (b).
For frequency mode k ∈ D, we have (F vt)(k) ∈ Cdv and Rφ(k) ∈ Cdv×dv . Notice that since we assume κ is periodic, it admits a Fourier series expansion, so we may work with the discrete modes k ∈ Zd. We pick a finite-dimensional parameterization by truncating the Fourier series at a maximal number of modes kmax = |Zkmax | = |{k ∈ Zd : |kj| ≤ kmax,j, for j = 1, . . . , d}|. We thus parameterize Rφ directly as complex-valued (kmax × dv × dv)-tensor comprising a collection of truncated Fourier modes and therefore drop φ from our notation. Since κ is real-valued, we impose conjugate symmetry. We note that the set Zkmax is not the canonical choice for the low frequency modes of vt. Indeed, the low frequency modes are usually defined by placing an upper-bound on the
`1-norm of k ∈ Zd. We choose Zkmax as above since it allows for an efficient implementation.
The discrete case and the FFT. Assuming the domain D is discretized with n ∈ N points, we have that vt ∈ Rn×dv and F (vt) ∈ Cn×dv . Since we convolve vt with a function which only
has kmax Fourier modes, we may simply truncate the higher modes to obtain F (vt) ∈ Ckmax×dv .
Multiplication by the weight tensor R ∈ Ckmax×dv×dv is then
(R · (F vt))
k,l =
dv
∑
j=1
Rk,l,j(F vt)k,j, k = 1, . . . , kmax, j = 1, . . . , dv. (5)
When the discretization is uniform with resolution s1 × · · · × sd = n, F can be replaced by the Fast
Fourier Transform. For f ∈ Rn×dv , k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈ Zs1 ×· · ·×Zsd , and x = (x1, . . . , xd) ∈ D, the FFT Fˆ and its inverse Fˆ−1 are defined as
(Fˆf )l(k) =

for l = 1, . . . , dv. In this case, the set of truncated modes becomes
Zkmax = {(k1, . . . , kd) ∈ Zs1 × · · · × Zsd | kj ≤ kmax,j or sj − kj ≤ kmax,j , for j = 1, . . . , d}.
When implemented, R is treated as a (s1 × · · · × sd × dv × dv)-tensor and the above definition of Zkmax corresponds to the “corners” of R, which allows for a straight-forward parallel implementation of (5) via matrix-vector multiplication. In practice, we have found that choosing kmax,j = 12 which yields kmax = 12d parameters per channel to be sufficient for all the tasks that we consider.
Parameterizations of R. In general, R can be defined to depend on (Fa) to parallel (3). Indeed, we can define Rφ : Zd × Rdv → Rdv×dv as a parametric function that maps (k, (F a)(k)) to the values of the appropriate Fourier modes. We have experimented with linear as well as neural network parameterizations of Rφ. We find that the linear parameterization has a similar performance to the previously described direct parameterization, while neural networks have worse performance. This is likely due to the discrete structure of the space Zd. Our experiments in this work focus on the direct parameterization presented above.
Invariance to discretization. The Fourier layers are discretization-invariant because they can learn from and evaluate functions which are discretized in an arbitrary way. Since parameters are learned directly in Fourier space, resolving the functions in physical space simply amounts to projecting on the basis e2πi〈x,k〉 which are well-defined everywhere on Rd. This allows us to achieve zero-shot super-resolution as shown in Section 5.4. Furthermore, our architecture has a consistent error at any resolution of the inputs and outputs. On the other hand, notice that, in Figure 3, the standard CNN methods we compare against have an error that grows with the resolution.
Quasi-linear complexity. The weight tensor R contains kmax < n modes, so the inner multiplication has complexity O(kmax). Therefore, the majority of the computational cost lies in computing
the Fourier transform F (vt) and its inverse. General Fourier transforms have complexity O(n2), however, since we truncate the series the complexity is in fact O(nkmax), while the FFT has complexity O(n log n). Generally, we have found using FFTs to be very efficient. However a uniform discretization is required.
5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we compare the proposed Fourier neural operator with multiple finite-dimensional architectures as well as operator-based approximation methods on the 1-d Burgers’ equation, the 2-d Darcy Flow problem, and 2-d Navier-Stokes equation. The data generation processes are discussed in Appendices A.3.1, A.3.2, and A.3.3 respectively. We do not compare against traditional solvers (FEM/FDM) or neural-FEM type methods since our goal is to produce an efficient operator approximation that can be used for downstream applications. We demonstrate one such application to the Bayesian inverse problem in Section 5.5.
We construct our Fourier neural operator by stacking four Fourier integral operator layers as specified in (2) and (4) with the ReLU activation as well as batch normalization. Unless otherwise specified, we use N = 1000 training instances and 200 testing instances. We use Adam optimizer to train for 500 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.001 that is halved every 100 epochs. We set kmax,j = 16, dv = 64 for the 1-d problem and kmax,j = 12, dv = 32 for the 2-d problems. Lower resolution data are downsampled from higher resolution. All the computation is carried on a single Nvidia V100 GPU with 16GB memory.
Remark on Resolution. Traditional PDE solvers such as FEM and FDM approximate a single function and therefore their error to the continuum decreases as the resolution is increased. On the other hand, operator approximation is independent of the ways its data is discretized as long as all relevant information is resolved. Resolution-invariant operators have consistent error rates among different resolutions as shown in Figure 3. Further, resolution-invariant operators can do zero-shot super-resolution, as shown in Section 5.4.

5.1 BURGERS’ EQUATION
The 1-d Burgers’ equation is a non-linear PDE with various applications including modeling the one dimensional flow of a viscous fluid. It takes the form
∂tu(x, t) + ∂x(u2(x, t)/2) = ν∂xxu(x, t), x ∈ (0, 1), t ∈ (0, 1]
u(x, 0) = u0(x), x ∈ (0, 1) (6)
with periodic boundary conditions where u0 ∈ L2
per((0, 1); R) is the initial condition and ν ∈ R+ is the viscosity coefficient. We aim to learn the operator mapping the initial condition to the solution at time one, G† : L2
per((0, 1); R) → Hr
per((0, 1); R) defined by u0 7→ u(·, 1) for any r > 0.
The results of our experiments are shown in Figure 3 (a) and Table 3 (Appendix A.3.1). Our proposed method obtains the lowest relative error compared to any of the benchmarks. Further, the error is invariant with the resolution, while the error of convolution neural network based methods (FCN) grows with the resolution. Compared to other neural operator methods such as GNO and MGNO that use Nystro ̈m sampling in physical space, the Fourier neural operator is both more accurate and more computationally efficient.
5.2 DARCY FLOW
We consider the steady-state of the 2-d Darcy Flow equation on the unit box which is the second order, linear, elliptic PDE
−∇ · (a(x)∇u(x)) = f (x) x ∈ (0, 1)2
u(x) = 0 x ∈ ∂(0, 1)2 (7)

with a Dirichlet boundary where a ∈ L∞((0, 1)2; R+) is the diffusion coefficient and f ∈
L2((0, 1)2; R) is the forcing function. This PDE has numerous applications including modeling the pressure of subsurface flow, the deformation of linearly elastic materials, and the electric potential in conductive materials. We are interested in learning the operator mapping the diffusion coefficient to the solution, G† : L∞((0, 1)2; R+) → H01((0, 1)2; R+) defined by a 7→ u. Note that
although the PDE is linear, the operator G† is not.
The results of our experiments are shown in Figure 3 (b) and Table 4 (Appendix A.3.2). The proposed Fourier neural operator obtains nearly one order of magnitude lower relative error compared to any benchmarks. We again observe the invariance of the error with respect to the resolution.
5.3 NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION
We consider the 2-d Navier-Stokes equation for a viscous, incompressible fluid in vorticity form on the unit torus:
∂tw(x, t) + u(x, t) · ∇w(x, t) = ν∆w(x, t) + f (x), x ∈ (0, 1)2, t ∈ (0, T ]
∇ · u(x, t) = 0, x ∈ (0, 1)2, t ∈ [0, T ]
w(x, 0) = w0(x), x ∈ (0, 1)2
(8)
where u ∈ C([0, T ]; Hr
per((0, 1)2; R2)) for any r > 0 is the velocity field, w = ∇ × u is the vorticity, w0 ∈ L2
per((0, 1)2; R) is the initial vorticity, ν ∈ R+ is the viscosity coefficient, and f ∈ L2
per((0, 1)2; R) is the forcing function. We are interested in learning the operator mapping the vorticity up to time 10 to the vorticity up to some later time T > 10, G† : C([0, 10]; Hr
per((0, 1)2; R)) → C((10, T ]; Hr
per((0, 1)2; R)) defined by w|(0,1)2×[0,10] 7→ w|(0,1)2×(10,T ]. Given the vorticity it is easy to derive the velocity. While vorticity is harder to model compared to velocity, it provides more information. By formulating the problem on vorticity, the neural network models mimic the pseudospectral method. We experiment with the viscosities ν = 1e−3, 1e−4, 1e−5, decreasing the final time T as the dynamic becomes chaotic. Since the baseline methods are not resolution-invariant, we fix the resolution to be 64 × 64 for both training and testing.

As shown in Table 1, the FNO-3D has the best performance when there is sufficient data (ν = 1e−3, N = 1000 and ν = 1e−4, N = 10000). For the configurations where the amount of data is insufficient (ν = 1e−4, N = 1000 and ν = 1e−5, N = 1000), all methods have > 15% error with FNO-2D achieving the lowest. Note that we only present results for spatial resolution 64 × 64 since all benchmarks we compare against are designed for this resolution. Increasing it degrades their performance while FNO achieves the same errors.
2D and 3D Convolutions. FNO-2D, U-Net, TF-Net, and ResNet all do 2D-convolution in the spatial domain and recurrently propagate in the time domain (2D+RNN). The operator maps the solution at the previous 10 time steps to the next time step (2D functions to 2D functions). On the other hand, FNO-3D performs convolution in space-time. It maps the initial time steps directly to the full trajectory (3D functions to 3D functions). The 2D+RNN structure can propagate the solution to any arbitrary time T in increments of a fixed interval length ∆t, while the Conv3D structure is fixed to the interval [0, T ] but can transfer the solution to an arbitrary time-discretization. We find the 3-d method to be more expressive and easier to train compared to its RNN-structured counterpart.

5.4 ZERO-SHOT SUPER-RESOLUTION.
The neural operator is mesh-invariant, so it can be trained on a lower resolution and evaluated at a higher resolution, without seeing any higher resolution data (zero-shot super-resolution). Figure 1 shows an example where we train the FNO-3D model on 64 × 64 × 20 resolution data in the setting above with (ν = 1e−4, N = 10000) and transfer to 256 × 256 × 80 resolution, demonstrating super-resolution in space-time. Fourier neural operator is the only model among the benchmarks (FNO-2D, U-Net, TF-Net, and ResNet) that can do zero-shot super-resolution. And surprisingly, it can do super-resolution not only in the spatial domain but also in the temporal domain.
5.5 BAYESIAN INVERSE PROBLEM
In this experiment, we use a function space Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (Cotter et al., 2013) to draw samples from the posterior distribution of the initial vorticity in Navier-Stokes given sparse, noisy observations at time T = 50. We compare the Fourier neural operator acting as a surrogate model with the traditional solvers used to generate our train-test data (both run on GPU). We generate 25,000 samples from the posterior (with a 5,000 sample burn-in period), requiring 30,000 evaluations of the forward operator.
As shown in Figure 6 (Appendix A.5), FNO and the traditional solver recover almost the same posterior mean which, when pushed forward, recovers well the late-time dynamic of Navier Stokes. In sharp contrast, FNO takes 0.005s to evaluate a single instance while the traditional solver, after being optimized to use the largest possible internal time-step which does not lead to blow-up, takes 2.2s. This amounts to 2.5 minutes for the MCMC using FNO and over 18 hours for the traditional solver. Even if we account for data generation and training time (offline steps) which take 12 hours, using FNO is still faster! Once trained, FNO can be used to quickly perform multiple MCMC runs for different initial conditions and observations, while the traditional solver will take 18 hours for every instance. Furthermore, since FNO is differentiable, it can easily be applied to PDE-constrained optimization problems without the need for the adjoint method.
Spectral analysis. Due to the way we parameterize Rφ, the function output by (4) has at most kmax,j Fourier modes per channel. This, however, does not mean that the Fourier neural operator can only approximate functions up to kmax,j modes. Indeed, the activation functions which occur between integral operators and the final decoder network Q recover the high frequency modes. As an example, consider a solution to the Navier-Stokes equation with viscosity ν = 1e−3. Truncating this function at 20 Fourier modes yields an error around 2% while our Fourier neural operator learns the parametric dependence and produces approximations to an error of ≤ 1% with only kmax,j = 12 parameterized modes.
Non-periodic boundary condition. Traditional Fourier methods work only with periodic boundary conditions. However, the Fourier neural operator does not have this limitation. This is due to the linear transform W (the bias term) which keeps the track of non-periodic boundary. As an example, the Darcy Flow and the time domain of Navier-Stokes have non-periodic boundary conditions, and the Fourier neural operator still learns the solution operator with excellent accuracy.
6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Requirements on Data. Data-driven methods rely on the quality and quantity of data. To learn Navier-Stokes equation with viscosity ν = 1e−4, we need to generate N = 10000 training pairs {aj, uj} with the numerical solver. However, for more challenging PDEs, generating a few training samples can be already very expensive. A future direction is to combine neural operators with numerical solvers to levitate the requirements on data. Recurrent structure. The neural operator has an iterative structure that can naturally be formulated as a recurrent network where all layers share the same parameters without sacrificing performance. (We did not impose this restriction in the experiments.) Computer vision. Operator learning is not restricted to PDEs. Images can naturally be viewed as real-valued functions on 2-d domains and videos simply add a temporal structure. Our approach is therefore a natural choice for problems in computer vision where invariance to discretization crucial is important (Chi et al., 2020).

A.2 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
The spectral decay of the Navier Stokes equation data is shown in Figure 4. The spectrum decay has a slope k−5/3, matching the energy spectrum in the turbulence region. And we notice the energy spectrum does not decay along with time.
We also present the spectral decay in term of the truncation kmax defined in 4 as shown in Figure5. We note all equations (Burgers, Darcy, and Navier-Stokes with ν ≤ 1e−4 ) exhibit high frequency modes. Even we truncate at kmax = 12 in the Fourier layer, the Fourier neural operator can recover the high frequency modes.
A.3 DATA GENERATION
In this section, we provide the details of data generator for the three equation we used in Section 5.

A.3.1 BURGERS EQUATION
Recall the 1-d Burger’s equation on the unit torus:
∂tu(x, t) + ∂x(u2(x, t)/2) = ν∂xxu(x, t), x ∈ (0, 1), t ∈ (0, 1]
u(x, 0) = u0(x), x ∈ (0, 1).
The initial condition u0(x) is generated according to u0 ∼ μ where μ = N (0, 625(−∆ + 25I)−2) with periodic boundary conditions. We set the viscosity to ν = 0.1 and solve the equation using a split step method where the heat equation part is solved exactly in Fourier space then the non-linear part is advanced, again in Fourier space, using a very fine forward Euler method. We solve on a spatial mesh with resolution 213 = 8192 and use this dataset to subsample other resolutions.
A.3.2 DARCY FLOW
The 2-d Darcy Flow is a second-order linear elliptic equation of the form
−∇ · (a(x)∇u(x)) = f (x) x ∈ (0, 1)2
u(x) = 0 x ∈ ∂(0, 1)2.
The coefficients a(x) are generated according to a ∼ μ where μ = ψ#N (0, (−∆ + 9I)−2) with zero Neumann boundary conditions on the Laplacian. The mapping ψ : R → R takes the value 12 on the positive part of the real line and 3 on the negative and the push-forward is defined pointwise. The forcing is kept fixed f (x) = 1. Such constructions are prototypical models for many physical systems such as permeability in subsurface flows and material microstructures in elasticity. Solutions u are obtained by using a second-order finite difference scheme on a 421 × 421 grid. Different resolutions are downsampled from this dataset.

A.3.3 NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION
Recall the 2-d Navier-Stokes equation for a viscous, incompressible fluid in vorticity form on the unit torus:
∂tw(x, t) + u(x, t) · ∇w(x, t) = ν∆w(x, t) + f (x), x ∈ (0, 1)2, t ∈ (0, T ]
∇ · u(x, t) = 0, x ∈ (0, 1)2, t ∈ [0, T ]
w(x, 0) = w0(x), x ∈ (0, 1)2.
The initial condition w0(x) is generated according to w0 ∼ μ where μ = N (0, 73/2(−∆+49I)−2.5) with periodic boundary conditions. The forcing is kept fixed f (x) = 0.1(sin(2π(x1 + x2)) + cos(2π(x1 + x2))). The equation is solved using the stream-function formulation with a pseudospectral method. First a Poisson equation is solved in Fourier space to find the velocity field. Then the vorticity is differentiated and the non-linear term is computed is physical space after which it is dealiased. Time is advanced with a Crank–Nicolson update where the non-linear term does not enter the implicit part. All data are generated on a 256 × 256 grid and are downsampled to 64 × 64. We use a time-step of 1e−4 for the Crank–Nicolson scheme in the data-generated process where we record the solution every t = 1 time units. The step is increased to 2e−2 when used in MCMC for the Bayesian inverse problem.
