I. Introduction

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) air combat evolution (ACE) program, seeks to build and enhance trust in autonomy for air-to-air combat and ultimately culminated in a live flight exercise with full-scale aircraft. The AlphaDogfight Trials (ADT) were created as a precursor to the larger ACE program in order to minimize risk. For ADT, teams proposed algorithmic solutions for one-versus-one within visual range (WVR) air combat, which is also known as a dogfight. Solutions submitted to ADT ranged from rule-based systems to end-to-end machine learning, and eight finalists were selected to perform on the program. Each team's solution was tested in simulated dogfights in a high-fidelity simulation environment that leveraged an F-16 flight dynamics model (FDM). Scrimmages were held against a variety of opponents including DARPA-provided agents exhibiting various behaviors (e.g., cruise missile-like behavior), other finalist's agents, and expert human fighter pilots.
