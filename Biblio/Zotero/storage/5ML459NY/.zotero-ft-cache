1 Introduction

Detecting humans in images is a challenging task owing to their variable appearance and the wide range of poses that they can adopt. The first need is a robust feature set that allows the human form to be discriminated cleanly, even in cluttered backgrounds under difficult illumination. We study the issue of feature sets for human detection, showing that locally normalized Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors provide excellent performance relative to other existing feature sets including wavelets [17], [22]. The proposed descriptors are reminiscent of edge orientation histograms [4], [5], SIFT descriptors [12] and shape contexts [1], but they are computed on a dense grid of uniformly spaced cells” and they use overlapping local contrast normalizations for improved performance. We make a detailed study of the effects of various implementation choices on detector performance, taking “pedestrian detection” (the detection of mostly visible people in more or less upright poses) as a test case. For simplicity and speed, we use linear SVM as a baseline classifier throughout the study. The new detectors give essentially perfect results on the MIT pedestrian test set [18], [17], so we have created a more challenging set containing over 1800 pedestrian images with a large range of poses and backgrounds. Ongoing work suggests that our feature set performs equally well for other shape-based object classes.
