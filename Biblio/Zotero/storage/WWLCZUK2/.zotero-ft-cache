In January 2013, an international group of simulation experts gathered in Orlando, Florida, U.S.A., to form a working team whose mission was to create a dictionary of terms used in healthcare simulation. This group recognized a need to compile terms that had been completed by other groups in healthcare simulation and to add more terms. The document you see represents the work of many individuals and their societies to compile and refine the dictionary. The goal of this project is to enhance communication and clarity for healthcare simulationists in teaching, education, assessment, research, and systems integration activities. The Agency for Health care Research and Quality (AHRQ) has partnered with the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) and its many affiliates to produce this comprehensive Healthcare Simulation Dictionary and disseminate it widely as part of SSH and AHRQ’s mission to improve patient safety, which includes simulation research.
Preamble
Since the first edition of the dictionary in 2016, SSH and international affiliate member representatives have met at the International Meeting for Simulation in Healthcare annually to define the process for revision and to discuss advances in simulation research, expansion of terms used in research, simulation certification, practice analysis research, and simulation accreditation terminology. Since the first edition of the dictionary in 2016, SSH and international affiliate member representatives have met at the International Meeting for Simulation in Healthcare annually to define the process for revision and to discuss advances in simulation research, expansion of terms used in research, simulation certification, practice analysis research, and simulation accreditation terminology. By 2019, a clear need for updates and additions to the Dictionary were recommended to support the expanded terms used in healthcare simulation. Further, in 2020, there was a clear need identified to add terms specific to simulation taking place in ways other than in-person (e.g., in a simulation center). In the second edition (v2.1), the following changes can be found:
• A section on common abbreviations was added, and 27 abbreviations were included.
• 49 new terms were added.
• 13 terms were expanded with additional definitions as reflected in the literature.
• An additional referent of “consider also” was added for terms that are not currently in the dictionary, but would support understanding of defined terms.
• A new section titled “Terms No Longer Recommended for Use by SSH” was added.
This is a living document and represents the sum of the work at this moment. Terms and definitions will continue to change and be clarified, added, or deleted over time.
The intent was to be inclusive of the various definitions in use, not to exclude any definitions or areas of healthcare simulation.
The definitions show how the terms are being used in healthcare simulation. It is not intended to prescribe or dictate one particular definition over another.
This dictionary focuses on healthcare-simulation-specific terms and meanings. Many terms that are generally used in education (e.g., educational design) and healthcare (e.g., ventricular fibrillation or anxiety) are not defined. Please refer to standard dictionaries and resources for these definitions.

This list of terms is not a taxonomy, nor should it be used as such. It may inform taxonomical work.
Terms that have been identified as potentially controversial have been noted with a * prior to the word.
The terms and spellings are written in standard American English. This was to aid in reducing clutter and support translation to other languages.
The etymologies are sourced from etymologyonline.com and are provided to give insight into word origins.
To date, the first edition of the dictionary has been translated into several languages, including Chinese, Italian, Russian, and Spanish by volunteer translators. These translations may be found at the bottom of the webpage at www.ssih.org/dictionary. If you are interested in translating the dictionary into another language, please contact SSH at communications@ssih.org and specify your request.
As a living document, all are encouraged to submit feedback using the form located a twww.ssih.org/dictionary. We realize there may be better insights into other terms or definitions, additional references, etc. Citations have been included wherever possible. Should you know of additional terms, definitions, and/or missing citations, please submit those as above via the Dictionary Feedback Form.
The Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) acknowledges the participation and input of many individuals and also the International Societies they represent. Without you, this would not have been possible! Thank you for your time and efforts in the creation and revision of this dictionary over the last seven years. We look forward to your continued contributions.

A
*Actor \ˈak-tər \ noun
Etym. late 14c., “an overseer, guardian, steward,” from Latin actor “an agent or doer,” also “theatrical player,” from past participle stem of agere. Sense of “one who performs in plays” is 1580s, originally applied to both men and women.
Definition
• In health care simulation, professional and/or amateur people trained to reproduce the components of real clinical experience, especially involving communication between health professionals and patients or colleagues (Australian Society for Simulation in Healthcare).

Adaptive Learning \ ə-ˈdap-tiv \ ˈlər-niŋ \ noun
Etym. Adapt (v.) early 15c. (implied in adapted) “to fit (something, for some purpose),” from Old French adapter (14c.), from Latin adaptare “adjust, fit to,” from ad “to” (see ad-) + aptare “to join,” from aptus “fitted” (see apt). Intransitive meaning “to undergo modification so as to fit new circumstances” is from 1956.
Etym. Learning (n.) Old English leornung “study, action of acquiring knowledge,” verbal noun from leornian (see learn). Meaning “knowledge acquired by systematic study, extensive literary and scientific culture” is from mid-14c. Learning curve attested by 1907.
Definition
• Adaptive learning incorporates a wide range of technologies and techniques that observes participants and adjusts the learning experience on demand to meet the unique needs of the participants and facilitate the individual/team members in meeting the identified objectives. (Akbulut & Cardak, 2012; Brusilovsky & Peylo, 2003; Pope, Gore, & Renfroe, 2012)
Advocacy and Inquiry \ad-və-kə-sē \ in-ˈkwī(-ə)r-e\ noun
Etym. advocate (n.) mid-14c., “one whose profession is to plead cases in a court of justice,” a technical term from Roman law. Also in Middle English as “one who intercedes for another,” and “protector, champion, patron.”
Etym. inquest (n.) mid-15c., enquery, from enquere (see ‘inquire’). From Latin methodus “way of teaching or going,” from Greek methodos “scientific inquiry,” method of inquiry, investigation.
Definition
• A method of debriefing in which an observer states what was observed or performed in a simulation activity (advocacy) or shares critical or appreciative insights about it explicitly (advocacy) and then asks the learners for an explanation of their thoughts or actions (inquiry)(Rudolph et al, 2007).
• Inquiry seeks to learn what others think, know, want, or feel; whereas advocacy includes statements that communicate what an individual thinks, knows, wants or feels (Bolman & Deal, 2013).
Alpha and Beta Testing \ ˈal-fə \ ˈbā-tə \ ˈte-stiŋ \ noun
Etym. alpha (adj.) c. 1300, from Latin alpha, from Greek alpha, from Hebrew or Phoenician aleph (see aleph). The Greeks added -a because Greek words cannot end in most consonants. Sense of “beginning of anything” is from late 14c., often paired with omega (the last letter in the Greek alphabet, representing “the end”); sense of “first in a sequence” is from 1620s.
Etym. beta (adj.) c. 1300, from Greek, from Hebrew/Phoenician beth (see alphabet); used to designate the second of many things.
Etym. test (v.) late 14c., the noun form “small vessel used in assaying precious metals,” from Old French test, from Latin testum “earthen pot,” related to testa “piece of burned clay, earthen pot, shell.” Sense of “trial or examination to determine the correctness of something” is recorded from 1590s. The connecting notion is “ascertaining the quality of a metal by melting it in a pot.” Testing as a verb came from 1748, “to examine the correctness of,” from the noun form.
Definition
• Alpha- early testing of a product by the developers or programmers, but not by potential users. The purpose of alpha-testing is to find and resolve as many ‘bugs’ or problems in the software that were unanticipated during the design and development. (Lee-Jayaram et al, 2019)
• Beta – early testing of a software, program, simulation, or game, by potential users. The purpose of beta-testing is identical to alpha-testing. (Lee-Jayaram et al, 2019)

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
\ ˌär-tə-ˈfi-shəl \ in-ˈte-lə-jən(t)s \ noun
Etym. artificial (adj.) late 14c., “not natural or spontaneous,” from Old French artificial, from Latin artificialis “of or belonging to art,” from artificium “a work of art; skill; theory, system,” from artifex (genitive artificis) “craftsman, artist, master of an art” (music, acting, sculpting, etc.), from stem of ars “art” + -fex “maker,” from facere “to do, make”.
Etym. intelligence (n.) late 14c., “the highest faculty of the mind, capacity for comprehending general truths;” c. 1400, “faculty of understanding, comprehension,” from Old French intelligence (12c.) and directly from Latin intelligentia, intellegentia “understanding, knowledge, power of discerning; art, skill, taste,” from intelligentem (nominative intelligens) “discerning, appreciative,” present participle of intelligere “to understand, comprehend, come to know,” from assimilated form of inter “between” (see inter-) + legere “choose, pick out, read,” Artificial intelligence “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines” was coined in 1956.
Definition
• A system of computerized data-gathering and prediction that models human behavior and decision-making with minimal human intervention. In healthcare simulation, AI often refers to underlying programming that provides physiological or systembased algorithm changes based on inputs from users and learners. Often paired with machine learning, in which the software is programmed to alter algorithms and predictions based on observed data and results without human intervention. Virtual patients use artificial intelligence to react appropriately to the user or learner. (Bennett and Hauser, 2013)

*Assessment \ ə-ˈses-mənt \ noun
Etym. (n.) “1530s, “value of property for tax purposes,” from assess + -ment. Meaning “act of determining or adjusting of tax rate, charges, damages, etc., to be paid” is from 1540s (earlier in this sense was assession, mid-15c.). General sense of “estimation” is recorded from 1620s; in education jargon from 1956.”
Definition
• Refers to processes that provide information about or feedback about individual participants, groups, or programs. Specifically, assessment refers to observations of progress related to knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSA). Findings of assessment are used to improve future outcomes (Scheckel, 2016; INACSL Standards Committee, 2016c, pp. S39-S40).
• Involves measurement of the KSAs which can be recorded (Levine, DeMaria, Schwartz, & Sim, 2014).
• Formative - a type of assessment (sometimes called an evaluation) “wherein the facilitator’s focus is on the participant’s progress toward goal attainment through preset criteria; a process for an individual or group engaged in a simulation activity for the purpose of providing constructive feedback for that individual or group to improve (National League for Nursing Simulation Innovation Resource Center [NLN-SIRC], 2013; Scheckel, 2016)” (INACSL Standards Committee, 2016c, p.S41). Often completed at the same time as the instruction (Hamdorf & Davies, 2016), development of the individual is the focus for the simulation objectives/outcomes to be reached (INACSL Standards Committee, 2016c).
• Summative - a type of assessment (sometimes called an evaluation) “at the end of a learning period or at a discrete point in time in which participants are provided with feedback about their achievement of outcome through preset criteria; a process for determining the competence of a participant engaged in healthcare activity. The assessment of achievement of outcome criteria may be associated with an assigned grade (NLN-SIRC, 2013; Scheckel, 2016)” (INACSL Standards Committee, 2016c, p. S41). Performance of the individual is compared to a specific standard (Hamdorf & Davies, 2016).
• High-stakes - a type of assessment (sometimes called an evaluation) “associated with a simulation activity that has a major academic, educational, or employment consequence (such as a grading decision, including pass or fail implications; a decision regarding competency, merit pay, promotion, or certification) at a discrete point in time (Hidden curriculum, 2014)” (INACSL Standards Committee, 2016c, p. S41).

Assessor \ ə-ˈse-sər \ noun
Etym. late 14c., from Old French assessor “assistant judge, assessor (in court)” (12c., Modern French assesseur) and directly from Latin assessor “an assistant, aid; an assistant judge.”
Definition
• A person who performs assessment of individuals according to pre-established criteria.
• Assessors must have specific and substantial training, expertise, and competency in assessment (Dictionary.com).

Augmented Reality \ȯg-ˈmen-təd \ rē-ˈa-lə-tē \ noun
Etym. augment (v.) c. 1400, from Old French augmenter “increase, enhance” (14c.), from Late Latin augmentare “to increase,” from Latin augmentum “an increase,” from augere “to increase, make big, enlarge, enrich.” Related: Augmented; augmenting.
Etym. reality (n.) 1540s, “quality of being real,” from French réalité and directly Medieval Latin realitatem (nominative realitas); Meaning “real existence, all that is real.”
Definition
• A type of virtual reality in which synthetic stimuli are superimposed on real-world objects, usually to make information that is otherwise imperceptible to human senses perceptible (M&S Glossary).
• A technology that overlays digital computer-generated information on objects or places in the real world for the purpose of enhancing the user experience.
• The combination of reality and overlay of digital information designed to enhance the learning process.
• A spectrum of mixed-reality simulation that is part way between the real world and the virtual world.
• A form of virtual reality that includes head-mounted displays, overlays of computer screens, wearable computers, or displays projected onto humans and manikins (D.R. Berryman et al; M. Bajura et al; H. Fuchs et al).
Avatar \ˈa-və-ˌtär\ noun
Etym. 1784, “descent of a Hindu deity,” from Sanskrit. In computer use, it seems to trace to the novel “Snowcrash” (1992) by Neal Stephenson.
Definition
• A virtual object used to represent a physical object (e.g., a human) in a virtual world.
• A graphical representation, typically three-dimensional, of a person capable of relatively complex actions, including facial expressions and physical responses, while participating in a virtual simulation-based experience. The user controls the avatar through the use of a mouse, keyboard, or a type of joystick to move through the virtual simulation-based experience (Riley, 2008).
• Controlled avatars may be either 1st-person perspective or 3rd-person perspective in virtual simulations. A 3rd-person perspective places the view and camera so the user and learner can see the controlled avatar (e.g., the player). A 1st-person perspective places the camera such that the user and learner views the world through the eyes of the avatar (i.e., the controlled avatar is never visible on the screen). These perspectives only apply to screen-based simulations using a mouse, keyboard, or joystick. Virtual Reality simulations are almost always 1st-person. (Schuurink and Toet, 2010)

Etym. back (adj.) “being behind, away from the front, in a backward direction,” Middle English, from back (n.) and back (adv.); often difficult to distinguish from these when the word is used in combinations. Formerly with comparative backer (c. 1400), also backermore. To be on the back burner in the figurative sense is from 1960, from the image of a cook keeping a pot there to simmer while at work on another concoction at the front of the stove.” “to or toward the rear or the original starting place; in the past; behind in position,” literally or figuratively, late 14c., shortened from abak, from Old English on bæc “backwards, behind, aback” (see back (n.), and compare aback).

[Century Dictionary] Meaning “recital of true events” first recorded late 14c.; sense of “narrative of fictitious events meant to entertain” is from c. 1500. Not differentiated from history until 1500s. As a euphemism for “a lie” it dates from 1690s. Meaning “newspaper article” is from 1892. Storyline first attested 1941. That’s another story “that requires different treatment” is attested from 1818. Story of my life “sad truth” first recorded 1938, from typical title of an autobiography.”
Definition
• “A narrative, which provides a history and/or background and is created for a fictional character(s) and/or about a situation for a SBE (Backstory, n.d.)” (INACSL Standards Committee, 2016c, p.S40).

Etym. “fact or situation of giving preliminary instructions.” 1910
Definition
• An activity immediately preceding the start of a simulation activity where the participants receive essential information about the simulation scenario, such as background information, vital signs, instructions, or guidelines. For example, before beginning a session, faculty conduct a briefing about the scenario to review the information being provided to the participants.
• The information and guidelines given to faculty or simulated patients participating in a scenario to allow them to fully prepare for interactions with the participants. Briefing materials could include a handover, physician referral letter, or an ambulance call transcript. For example, at the start of the simulation scenario, participants receive a notification from ambulance personnel regarding a patient being transported to their facility with a gunshot wound. (Alinier, 2011; Husebø et al., 2012).

Cognitive Load \ ˈkäg-nə-tiv \ ˈlōd \ noun
Etym. Cognitive (adv.) 1580s, “pertaining to cognition,” with -ive + Latin cognit-, past participle stem of cognoscere “to get to know, recognize,” from assimilated form of com “together” (see co-) + gnoscere “to know,” from PIE root *gno- “to know.” Taken over by psychologists and sociologists after c. 1940. Cognitive dissonance “psychological distress cause by holding contradictory beliefs or values” (1957) apparently was coined by U.S. social psychologist Leon Festinger, who developed the concept.

Definition
• A person who has been carefully coached to simulate an actual patient so accurately that the simulation cannot be detected by a skilled clinician. In performing the simulation, the SP presents the gestalt of the patient being simulated; not just the history, but the body language, the physical findings, and the emotional and personality characteristics as well (Barrows, 1993).
• An individual trained to portray a patient with a specific condition in a realistic, standardized, and repeatable way and where portrayal/presentation varies based only on learner performance; this strict standardization of performance in a simulated session is what can distinguish standardized patients from simulated patients.
• SPs can be used for teaching and assessment of learners, including but not limited to history/consultation, physical examination, and other clinical skills in simulated clinical environments Association of Standardized Patient Educators (ASPE). SPs can also be used to give feedback and evaluate learner performance (ASPE).
• An individual who is trained to portray a real patient in order to simulate a set of symptoms or problems used for healthcare education, evaluation, and research (SSH).
• •More commonly used in the USA and Canada in large part because SPs participate in high stakes assessments in which SP responses to the learner were standardized. In recent years as SPs have been included in more formative teaching scenarios, its meaning has become interchangeable with the term simulated patient.

Etym. tele (adj.) before vowels tel-, word-forming element meaning “far, far off, operating over distance” (also, since c. 1940, “television”), from Greek tele “far off, afar, at or to a distance,” related to teleos (genitive telos) “end, goal, completion, result,” from PIE root *kwel- (2) “far” in space or time.”
Etym. simulation (n.) noun of action from past participle stem of simulare “imitate,” from stem of similis “like”. Meaning “a model or mock-up for purposes of experiment or training” is from 1954.
Defintion
• “A telesimulation platform utilizes communications technology to provide mannequin-based simulation education between learners and instructors located remotely from one another. Specifically, the instructor controls the mannequin and moderates the debriefing remotely. During these sessions, the instructor observes the learners in real time and provides immediate feedback during the debriefing. This platform obviates the need to have instructors, learners, and mannequins in the same place at the same time, potentially allowing simulationbased educational sessions to occur with greater frequency for institutions not located proximate to formal simulation centers. Additionally, the telesimulation platform enables an experienced simulation instructor to observe and directly help new simulation instructors at remote simulation locations. Readily available Webconferencing, screen-sharing software, microphones, and webcams
makes telesimulation possible. Mannequin-based telesimulation is relatively new and not well represented in the literature, but could facilitate systems changes, providing educational experiences to healthcare professionals in locations not currently benefiting from mannequin-based simulation opportunities. Several research questions need to be addressed in future studies to better develop this educational approach, including technical feasibility, logistic issues, a comparison of telesimulation to other simulation approaches, and assessing limitations of the telesimulation platform” (Hayden et al., 2018, p. 144).
• “Telesimulation (TS) is a novel concept that uses the internet to link simulators between an instructor and a trainee in different locations” (Okrainec et al., 2010, p. 417). “Telesimulation uses the Internet to link simulators between an instructor and trainee in different locations” (Okrainec et al., 2010, p. 417). “Using two simulators, multiple computers, a series of webcams, and basic video conferencing software, the instructor and trainee can see within each other’s simulators as well as see and speak to each other” (Okrainec et al., 2010, p. 418). Telesimulation differs from “telementoring or teleconferencing because it actually connects two simulators in different physical locations,” allowing teacher and student to see, but not control, what the other is doing in real time (Okrainec et al., 2010, p. 418). “Telesimulation is a novel, practical, inexpensive, effective, and well-received method for teaching appropriate procedural skills” (Mikrogianakis et al., 2011, p. 427).

Etym. world (n.) Originally “life on earth, this world (as opposed to the afterlife),” sense extended to “the known world,” then to “the physical world in the broadest sense, the universe” (c. 1200). In Old English gospels, the commonest word for “the physical world,” was Middangeard (Old Norse Midgard), literally “the middle enclosure” (see yard (n.1)), which is rooted in Germanic cosmology. Greek kosmos in its ecclesiastical sense of “world of people” sometimes was rendered in Gothic as manaseþs, literally “seed of man.” The usual Old Norse word was heimr, literally “abode” (see home). Words for “world” in some other Indo-European languages derive from the root for “bottom, foundation” (such as Irish domun, Old Church Slavonic duno, related to English deep); the Lithuanian word is pasaulis, from pa- “under” + saulė “sun.”
Definition
• Similar to Virtual Environment, though implies multiple characters, learners, or participants and potentially, a larger scale than a virtual environment. (Chang and Weiner, 2016).
• A virtual world or massively multiplayer online world (MMOW) in a computer-based simulated environment (Change et al, 2016).

Definition
• First used in the military, the Wide Area Virtual Environment is a non-proprietary term similar to a CAVE, in which participant(s) undergo a simulation within an area enclosed by walls with projected images. Specialized goggles are not required for WAVEs.
• WAVES can be very large, almost 8,000 square feet (745 square meters) with multiple chambers, corridors, and sections. The walls act as large movie screens with continued projected images, and sound systems enable participants to echolocate ambient noises.

Definition
• An individual(s) who, during the course of the clinical scenario, provides assistance locating and/or troubleshooting equipment. This individual(s) may provide support for participants in the form of ‘help available’, e.g., ‘nurse in charge’, and/or to provide information about the manikin that is not available in other ways, e.g., temperature, color change, and/or to provide additional realism by playing the role of a relative or a staff member (ASSH).
• An individual other than the patient who is scripted in a simulation to provide realism, additional challenges or additional information for the learner e.g., paramedic, receptionist, family member, laboratory technician (Victorian Simulated Patient Network).
Instead, use one of the following as best fits: ACTOR, EMBEDDED PARTICIPANT, SIMULATED PATIENT, SIMULATED PERSON, STANDARDIZED PATIENT
