3D Gaussians


● 3D Gaussian
● 2D projection, where W is viewing transformation, and J is the Jacobian of
affine projective transformation.
● Positive semi-definite covariance, where S is scale and R is rotation matrix.

3D Gaussian Optimization
→ Gradient Descent
● There is no neural networks to optimize!


● Clone 3D gaussians: Under-reconstruction (missing geometric features)
● Split 3D gaussians: Over-reconstruction (covering large area)
● Remove 3D gaussians: Opacity is lower than threshold
